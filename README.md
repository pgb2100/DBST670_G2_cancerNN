## Neural Network for Drug Efficiency Against Tumors
We will use data from http://cancerrgene.org
The drug with the lowest IC50 index is the drug that has the highest efficiency.The concentration of a drug or inhibitor needed to inhibit a biological process or response by 50%.IC50 is commonly used as a measure of drug potency in whole cell assays. IC50 assays are also used for screening in target-based drug discovery campaigns.
## Libraries Needed
